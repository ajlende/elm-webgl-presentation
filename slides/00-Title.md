### My day job
- Turn data into stories and share on the Systems of Life 10-foot media wall in the lobby.
- Explore emerging technologies and their applications in the healthcare system.

### How WebGL and Elm fit in
- All visualizations for the media wall are built with Blender, Three.js, or Cesium.js
- I've had a longstanding interest in computer graphics because my dad was a graphic designer and showed me Illustrator and Photoshop
- Led me to take graphics in college where we were the first class to try JavaScript/WebGL instead of C++/OpenGL (I'd already dabbled around in three.js at this point)
- My front-end journey (the short version):
    1. jQuery (back when it was the-bomb.com)
    2. Angular.js (before the rewrite)
    3. React (a brand new framework that got me into FRP)
    4. Dart & React (like TypeScript before TypeScript, but it made me sick of types)
    5. Cycle.js (minimalist FRP framework based on observables; RxJS at the time)
    6. Elm (because Cycle.js was inspired by Elm)
- 1-4 professionally, 5-6 for personal projects
