## What's Elm?

[elm-lang.org](http://elm-lang.org/)

Notes:

- Programming language for building webapps
- Delightful experience
- No runtime exceptions

### A Delightful Language for Reliable Webapps

[Let's be Mainstream!](http://www.elmbark.com/2016/03/16/mainstream-elm-user-focused-design)

Notes:

Emphasis on simplicity, ease of use, and quality tooling

Next version focusing more on shipping production web webapps

Comparable to React in terms of bundle size and performance

---


### No Runtime Exceptions

[Compilers as Assistants](http://elm-lang.org/blog/compilers-as-assistants)

Notes:

Statically typed language that catches errors during compilation

No `null` or `undefined is not a function`

Incredibly easy to refactor because the compiler tells you where you need to fix things

Enforced semantic versioning removes surprises in minor and patch releases

### Why Elm?

[elm-community/webgl](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-community/webgl/latest)

- Easy to lean
- Less boilerplate
- Integrated into lang
- Type checking
- Functional ;)

Notes:

Specifically, why Elm for WebGL

Now it's time to mention that it's a functional programming language
